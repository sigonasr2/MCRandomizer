# MCRandomizer
Ever wanted to play Minecraft with a brand new set of recipes and having to go through a harder grind from scratch? Look no further. This is a randomizer that makes your gameplay experience a little more fresh. Take every recipe you have come to know and love and try your hand at them again...You may notice this time items produced are different than before!

## Features
- All Crafting Recipes are shuffled, this includes recipes used for other tools/machines as well. You will need to learn a new set of crafting rules to beat the game.
- **The Crafting Table Recipe** is untouched. Find some planks and get a crafting table to unlock 3x3 crafting.
- Other events in the game may drop or give items that you may not normally expect.
- Seeded adventures! Every world seed that you play on will have a different set of crafting rules. Enjoy new playthroughs on worlds as you try to unlock all recipes.
- Compatibility with **Version 1.14.2** of Minecraft (Spigot Plugin for a Spigot server).

## To Be Added:
- Randomize Fishing recipes
- Randomize Brewing/Potion recipes
- Advanced logic and checks to verify entire game can be completed from start to finish.
